This chapter introduces the basics of programming in Python, focusing on how Python represents numbers, letters, and words. Key topics include:

- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`) and their usage.
- The concept of expressions, values, and types (`int`, `float`, `str`).
- Basic functions like `round`, `abs`, and `len`.
- Strings and operations like concatenation and repetition.
- Differences between natural and formal languages.
- Debugging techniques and the importance of learning from errors.

## [Chapter 2](Python_Chapter_2/chap02.ipynb): Printing

_January 31, 2025_

This chapter builds on the basics of Python programming by introducing variables, statements, and the `print` function. Key topics include:

- Understanding variables and assignment statements.
- Using the `import` statement to access modules like `math`.
- The difference between expressions and statements.
- The `print` function for displaying output.
- Arguments and how they are passed to functions.
- Writing comments to document code.
- Debugging common errors: syntax, runtime, and semantic errors.

## [Chapter 5](Python_Chapter_5/chap05.ipynb): Conditionals and Recursion

_March 2, 2025_

This chapter introduces the concepts of conditionals and recursion, which are fundamental to programming. Key topics include:

- Writing conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and their usage in decision-making.
- Nested conditionals and their applications.
- The concept of recursion and how functions can call themselves.
- Writing recursive functions to solve problems like factorials and Fibonacci sequences.
- Understanding the base case and recursive case in recursion.
- Debugging recursive functions and avoiding infinite recursion.

## [Chapter 6](Python_Chapter_6/chap06.ipynb): Functions with Return Values

_March 10, 2025_

This chapter builds on the basics of functions by introducing return values and their importance. Key topics include:

- Writing functions that return values using the `return` statement.
- Understanding the difference between functions that return values and those that modify objects.
- Using return values in expressions and assignments.
- Writing pure functions and understanding their benefits.
- The concept of scope and how variables are accessed within functions.
- Writing reusable and modular code by breaking problems into smaller functions.

## [Chapter 7](Python_Chapter_7/chap07.ipynb): Lists and Loops

_April 1, 2025_

This chapter introduces lists, one of Python's most versatile data structures, and explores their interaction with loops. Key topics include:

- Creating and manipulating lists.
- Accessing elements using indices and slicing.
- Using loops to iterate over lists.
- Common list operations like appending, extending, and removing elements.
- Nested lists and their applications.
- Sorting and reversing lists.
- Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable objects.
- Writing functions that operate on lists.

## [Chapter 8](Python_Chapter_8/chap08.ipynb): Strings and Writing Files

_April 17, 2025_

This chapter focuses on working with strings and introduces file handling in Python. Key topics include:

- String operations like slicing, concatenation, and repetition.
- String methods such as `split`, `join`, `strip`, and `replace`.
- Using loops to process strings character by character.
- Writing and reading text files using Python's built-in file handling functions.
- Cleaning and processing text data.
- Using regular expressions to search for patterns in strings.
- Writing programs that manipulate text files and perform find-and-replace operations.
